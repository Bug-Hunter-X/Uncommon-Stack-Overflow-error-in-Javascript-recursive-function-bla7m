# Uncommon Stack Overflow error in Javascript recursive function This repository demonstrates an uncommon stack overflow error that can occur in a Javascript recursive function. The bug occurs due to an incorrect base case condition, which causes infinite recursion.  The recursive function `foo` is designed to reach termination criteria, when 'a' becomes 1 or 'b' becomes 2. The problem is that the current termination criteria will never be met. As a result, the function continues to call itself indefinitely, eventually leading to a stack overflow error.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly define the base case to prevent this issue.  This example highlights the importance of carefully designing the termination condition in recursive functions to prevent runtime errors and improve code robustness.
