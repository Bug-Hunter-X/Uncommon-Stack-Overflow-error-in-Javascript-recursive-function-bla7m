function foo(a,b){    if (a == 1) {        return true;    } else if (b == 2) {        return false;    } else {        return foo(a -1, b + 1);    } } console.log(foo(3,0)); // Stack Overflow error because it will infinitely call foo() without reaching base case where 'a' becomes 1 or 'b' becomes 2.  The condition will never reach these termination criteria because a will decrease by one and b will increase by one, until the stack runs out of space.
